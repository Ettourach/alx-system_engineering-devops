Webstack debugging refers to the process of identifying, diagnosing, and fixing issues within a web application. A "webstack" typically consists of multiple layers, including the front-end, back-end, database, server, and network.

This was the first in a series of web stack debugging projects. In these projects, I was given broken/bugged webstacks in isolated containers, and tasked with fixing the web stack to a working state. For each task, I wrote a script automating the commands necessary to fix the web stack.
