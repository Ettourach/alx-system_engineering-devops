#Web stack monitoring

1.Server monitoring is the process of continuously tracking and analyzing the performance, health, and resource usage of a server to ensure that it operates efficiently and reliably. It involves collecting data on various metrics such as CPU usage, memory usage, disk space, network traffic, and uptime, and then using this information to detect potential issues, identify performance bottlenecks, and prevent failures.

2.Application monitoring is the process of tracking and analyzing the performance, functionality, and availability of software applications to ensure they run smoothly and deliver the expected user experience. This type of monitoring focuses on collecting and analyzing data about the application's behavior, performance metrics, error rates, and user interactions to detect issues and ensure optimal performance.
